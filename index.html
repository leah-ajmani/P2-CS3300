			<h2 class="header_positive">Correlation</h2>
			<p>Cars, especially expensive cars, have always been seen as a status symbol in rap music. When the economy is up, rappers rap about some the most expensive and gaudy cars. Known for their exotic designs and loud engines, Bentley, Ferrari and Lamborghini all get mentioned more when the economy is doing well.</p>

		<div id="panel2">
			<h2 class="header_negative">Inverse Correlation</h2>
			<p>Rappers tend to write about cheaper cars when the economy is down. Audi, Porsche and Chevrolet were all rapped about more during the Great Recession. While these brands are still sporty, they all sell models that are below $50,000.</p>
